Before running either agent the dependencies listed in \texttt{requirements.txt} should be installed\footnote{on systems with both \textit{Python 3} and \textit{Python 2} installed the \textit{pip} version installed with \textit{Python 3} should used, often called with \texttt{pip3}}.%

The mountain car agent can then be started by calling \texttt{src/mountain\_car/main.py} with \textit{Python 3}. The breakout agent is started by calling \texttt{src/breakout/main.py} again using \textit{Python 3}. Both agents log their progress to standard out (std-out), to create the plots seen in the report redirect std-out to a file and place it in a directory \texttt{logs}. Then change \texttt{logs\_to\_graphs.py} in either \texttt{src/breakout/} or \texttt{src/mountain\_car/}.
